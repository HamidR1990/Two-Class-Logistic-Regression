# Two-Class logistic Regression


##### This is python code for the logistic regression algorithm with 2 class on target variable. In this little project, through logistic regression algorithm we predict the label of a sample based on its features. The labe can be either 0 or 1.




#### The main object of this project is to write a logistic regression algorithm without using usual libraries, in particular, scikit-learn and other prepared tools.



### Dataset:

"exam.csv" is a very small dataset which is suitable for our mini project. Each record show the hours that a sample (student) has studied and the result of the exam which could be either fail (0) or pass (1).
